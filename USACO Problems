I have the general idea but i dont know what to put

You want to have a scanner to scan a bad word EX/ "F-Bomb"
You want to display it by minusing the bad word
You want to run a For Loop so the bad word if it occurs more than once all the instances get DELETED
Now Farmer John has a good cow

Unsure if this code is right

public class ScannerDemo {
    public static void main(String[] arguments){
       //Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
       String s =  "InputStringNewStringOldString";
       String t = "F-Bomb";
       int i = 1;
       boolean found = true;
        //System.out.println(s);
        //System.out.println(t);
        
        //while (found) {
            //s.toLowerCase().contains(t.toLowerCase())
            int pos = s.indexOf(t);
            int tl = t.length();
            String ns = s.replace(t,"");
            //i++;
            System.out.println(ns);
        //}

    }
}
